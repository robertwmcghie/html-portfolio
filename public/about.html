  <p>
    My name is Robbie McGhie, an aspiring web developer. I had my first taste of
    web design, with an introductory course in 2015.<br />
    Instantly I fell in love with web design/development, but unfortunately did
    not have the opportunity to continue. Now, ten years<br />
    later, despite my advanced age, I am still passionate about it and have decided to
    chase my dream. I am simultaneously pursuing online<br />
    courses on Udemy and Frontend Simplified.

    Currently I work at NYU Langone Hospital as a Hospital Consierge in a
    medicine unit, a job I find quite unfullfilling, hence my<br />
    determination to achieve my goal of becoming a frontend developer by the
    ending of 2025 .
